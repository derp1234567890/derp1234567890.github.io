	<ol>
		<li id="t4q1">Is most transportation in your city public (like a train or bus), or private (like an individual car)? What are the pros and cons of each? </li>
	<p id="t4q1answer">Answer) Most transportation in our city is public like maglavators hyperloops, and skybridges, while pods provide privacy they are not normally owned by the citizen and are rather rented out for durations of time decreasing overall cost due to extremely low price rates. Pros, Since the majority of our transportation methods are public they offer increased opportunity for our citizens to interact and improve overall quality of life. Cons this means that there are limited but still ampul opportunities for citizens to have the privacy that they sometimes want and need while we would prefer if they interacted with each other it is still their choice. Another con is that public transportation could become crowded and uncomfortable for citizens that would rather not be crowded by other people while moving at extremely fast speeds.</p>
